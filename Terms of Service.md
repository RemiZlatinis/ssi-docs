# Terms of Service

Effective Date: October 1, 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Service Status Indicator (SSI) - Monitoring Framework ("Service"), an open-source project provided by Apostolos Zlatinis aka Remi ("we," "us," or "our"). The Service includes the Client applications (such as the Expo React Native app for Android), the Agent (a Python-based daemon and CLI for Linux machines with systemd), and the hosted Backend (a cloud-based service handling authentication, accounts, and push notifications).

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our separate Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. We may update these Terms from time to time; changes will be notified to active users via email. Your continued use after such notification constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 1. Description of the Service

The Service is an open-source monitoring framework designed for Linux power users and administrators. It allows you to monitor services on your Linux machines via the Agent, which reports statuses to the Backend. The Backend acts as an intermediary, enabling Clients (e.g., mobile apps) to receive real-time updates and push notifications. The Agent supports user-defined scripts managed via systemd. A central Backend is hosted by us, with plans for a minimalistic open-source Flask version.

Most components are licensed under the MIT License, though some are not yet published as the project is in early development. You are responsible for complying with the applicable license terms for any open-source elements you use or contribute to.

## 2. Eligibility and User Accounts

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service, though it is designed for advanced users and may be too complex for younger individuals. No formal age restrictions apply.

To use certain features, such as push notifications or monitoring, you must create an account via Google Single Sign-On (SSO) through Firebase. You agree to provide accurate information and maintain the security of your account. You are responsible for all activities under your account.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these Terms. If your account is suspended, you may appeal the decision by emailing remizlatinis@gmail.com within 30 days, providing details and evidence supporting your case. We will review your appeal and respond within one month.

## 3. User Conduct and Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Service responsibly and not to:

- Abuse the Service in any way, including overloading the Backend, sending spam, or using it for illegal activities.
- Interfere with the Service's operation or other users' access.
- Upload or transmit viruses, malware, or harmful code.
- Violate any applicable laws or third-party rights.

The Agent is installed on your own Linux machine, and you are solely responsible for its configuration, scripts, and any data it processes or reports. Violations may result in account suspension or termination, with potential sanctions including permanent bans for repeated offenses.

## 4. Intellectual Property

The Service, including its software, documentation, and trademarks, is owned by us or our licensors. Open-source components are provided under the MIT License, granting you rights to use, modify, and distribute them accordingly. You retain ownership of any custom scripts or data you create.

By using the Service, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use any feedback or suggestions you provide for improving the Service.

## 5. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or related to: (a) your use of the Service; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your infringement of any third-party rights; or (d) any claims related to your custom scripts, Agent configurations, or data processed through the Service.

## 6. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. We are not liable for any data loss, service downtime, or issues arising from the Agent's performance on your machine.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the past 12 months (which is zero for free users).

### Force Majeure

Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under these Terms due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, pandemics, natural disasters, governmental actions, or widespread internet outages. The affected party shall notify the other as soon as practicable and resume performance when the event ends.

## 7. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause, including for violations of these Terms. Upon termination, your account and data may be deleted, though you can re-sign up as the project is in early stages. We will provide notice where feasible, and safeguards against arbitrary terminations include the appeal process outlined in Section 2.

You may terminate your account at any time by deleting it or ceasing use.

## 8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of the European Union, with specific alignment to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as we are based in the EU.

Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall first be attempted to be resolved through good faith negotiations between the parties. If unresolved within 30 days, the parties may submit the dispute to mediation under the rules of the European Mediation Institute. If mediation fails, the dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SCC Arbitration Institute. The seat of arbitration shall be Athens, Greece; the language shall be English; and the substantive law shall be that of Greece.

## 9. Accessibility

We are committed to ensuring the Service is accessible to people with disabilities. We aim to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards. This includes features like keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and high-contrast modes where applicable. Known limitations: Some third-party components (e.g., Firebase integrations) may have accessibility gaps, which we are working to address. If you encounter barriers, contact us at remizlatinis@gmail.com for assistance or to report issues.

## 10. Miscellaneous

If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, the remainder shall remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us.
